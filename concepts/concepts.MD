# Pygame
Pygame is a free, open-source in python library to create 2D games

# Sprite
In the context of computer graphics, a sprite is a 2D image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene. It's often used in 2D video games to represent characters, items, or other visual elements.

In Pygame, a sprite is represented by the pygame.sprite.Sprite class. This class is designed to be used as a base class for the sprites in your game. It includes basic functionality like tracking the sprite's position and updating the sprite's state.

# Mixer 
pygame module for loading and playing sounds is available and initialized before using it

# Clock
It is a function that makes a clock objects that can be used to keep track of time

# Dashboard
In general terms is a user interface that organizes and presents information in a way that is easy to read and interpret. It usually aggregates data, metrics, or key performance indicators (KPIs)

# Object Oriented Programming
OOP is useful in Pygame because it helps organize your code by bundling related data and behaviors into objects, making the code more modular and easier to manage. It enables reusability through classes, inheritance to share common features across different game entities, and polymorphism to handle different objects uniformly. This leads to more maintainable, readable, and scalable code, which is crucial as your game grows in complexity.

# Surface
There are two different kinds of surfaces:
    1. Display surface: The game window anything displayed goes on here
    2. Regular surface: Essentially a single image imported
