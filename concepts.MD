* Sprite
In the context of computer graphics, a sprite is a 2D image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene. It's often used in 2D video games to represent characters, items, or other visual elements.

In Pygame, a sprite is represented by the pygame.sprite.Sprite class. This class is designed to be used as a base class for the sprites in your game. It includes basic functionality like tracking the sprite's position and updating the sprite's state.
